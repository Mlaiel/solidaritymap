# SolidarityMap-AI 🌍❤️

*An AI-powered humanitarian platform connecting those who need help with those who can provide it - for humans and animals alike.*

## 🤝 Introduction

SolidarityMap-AI is an open-source humanitarian platform that transforms compassion into action. By enabling anyone to mark locations on a map where homeless individuals or stray animals need assistance, we create a real-time network of solidarity. Nearby volunteers receive instant notifications and can provide immediate help - whether it's food, blankets, medical care, or simply human kindness.

Built on principles of **dignity**, **respect**, and **inclusivity**, SolidarityMap-AI bridges the gap between those in need and those willing to help, fostering communities where no one - human or animal - is left behind.
