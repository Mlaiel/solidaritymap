# SolidarityMap-AI Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: Create an open-source humanitarian platform that connects community members to help homeless individuals and stray animals through real-time location-based assistance requests.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Number of successful help connections made
- Response time between request and assistance
- Community engagement and volunteer participation
- Accessibility compliance and multilingual usage

**Experience Qualities**: Compassionate, Inclusive, Immediate

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Real-time map-based reporting system
- Community notification and response system
- Accessibility-first design with voice/text support
- Offline-capable with sync functionality

**Primary User Activity**: Acting (reporting needs) and Interacting (providing help)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Homeless individuals and stray animals often need immediate assistance (food, shelter, medical care), but there's no efficient way to connect those in need with willing community helpers nearby.

**User Context**: 
- Street-level reporting by anyone who sees someone/animal in need
- Volunteers/NGOs monitoring their area for assistance opportunities
- Emergency situations requiring quick community response
- Users may have varying technical literacy and accessibility needs

**Critical Path**: 
1. See someone in need → Open app → Mark location → Add description → Submit
2. Receive notification → View request details → Decide to help → Mark as "helping" → Provide assistance → Mark as "helped"

**Key Moments**: 
1. Effortless reporting with minimal friction
2. Clear, respectful request visualization 
3. Immediate notification to nearby helpers

## Essential Features

### Map-Based Reporting System
- **Functionality**: GPS-based location marking with categorized need types
- **Purpose**: Enable quick, accurate reporting of assistance needs
- **Success Criteria**: Reports can be submitted in under 30 seconds

### Community Response Network
- **Functionality**: Real-time notifications to volunteers within configurable radius
- **Purpose**: Connect helpers with those in need efficiently
- **Success Criteria**: Average response time under 15 minutes during active hours

### Accessibility-First Interface
- **Functionality**: Voice input/output, screen reader support, multilingual interface
- **Purpose**: Ensure platform usability for users with disabilities
- **Success Criteria**: WCAG AA compliance, tested with assistive technologies

### Privacy-Respecting Documentation
- **Functionality**: Optional photo uploads with privacy controls and dignity protection
- **Purpose**: Provide context while protecting vulnerable individuals
- **Success Criteria**: No identifying information exposed, user consent required

### Offline Capability
- **Functionality**: Core features work without internet, sync when connected
- **Purpose**: Ensure reliability in areas with poor connectivity
- **Success Criteria**: Full reporting functionality available offline

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Trust, warmth, urgency without alarm, community connection
**Design Personality**: Compassionate, professional, approachable, inclusive
**Visual Metaphors**: Connecting hearts, community circles, helping hands, safe harbors
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean minimal interface that doesn't overwhelm users in stressful situations

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with warm accent
**Primary Color**: Deep teal (oklch(0.5 0.15 200)) - conveys trust, stability, healthcare
**Secondary Colors**: Soft gray (oklch(0.7 0.02 60)) - professional, accessible
**Accent Color**: Warm coral (oklch(0.7 0.15 40)) - urgency, community, warmth
**Color Psychology**: Teal builds trust and calm professionalism, coral adds human warmth and call-to-action energy
**Color Accessibility**: All combinations tested for WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 contrast minimum)

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headings, medium subheadings, regular body text
**Font Personality**: Inter conveys accessibility, clarity, and modern professionalism
**Readability Focus**: Large touch targets, generous line spacing, high contrast
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent scale (1.25 ratio) across all text elements
**Which fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts) - excellent accessibility and multilingual support
**Legibility Check**: Inter tested across devices and screen readers

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Critical actions (report, help) prominently placed with color and size
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load and improve focus
**Grid System**: 12-column responsive grid with consistent gutters
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement
**Content Density**: Minimal interface focusing on essential information only

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions to guide attention and provide feedback
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Priority on loading states and success confirmations
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Gentle, calming animations that don't delay critical actions

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for request display with clear visual hierarchy
- Buttons with distinct primary/secondary styling
- Badges for status indication
- Dialogs for request details and photo viewing
- Form components with clear validation states

**Component Customization**: 
- Increased touch targets for accessibility
- High contrast focus states
- Gentle rounded corners (0.75rem) for approachable feel

**Component States**: All interactive elements have clear hover, focus, active, and disabled states
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistency - heart, map pin, users, plus, check
**Spacing System**: 4px base unit with consistent rhythm throughout
**Mobile Adaptation**: Stack layouts vertically, increase touch targets, optimize for thumb navigation

### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance minimum, AAA where possible
**Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML structure
**Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility with visible focus indicators
**Voice Interface**: Speech recognition for hands-free reporting

- That English-first design works for diverse communities

**Exceptional Elements**: 
- Mandatory attribution preserving creator recognition
- Accessibility-first design from the ground up
- Community-driven rather than organization-driven approach
- Balance between transparency and privacy protection
